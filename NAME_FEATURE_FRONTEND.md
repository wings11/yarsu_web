# Name Feature - Frontend Implementation Complete âœ…

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated Type Definitions
**File:** `src/lib/supabase.ts`
- Added `name?: string | null` to the User interface

### 2. Updated API Service
**File:** `src/lib/api.ts`
- Added `getUserProfile()` method
- Added `updateUserName(name: string)` method

### 3. Created Name Modal Component
**File:** `src/components/auth/NameModal.tsx`
- Beautiful modal with backdrop blur
- Form validation (2-255 characters)
- Loading state during submission
- Cannot be dismissed without entering name
- Toast notifications for success/error

### 4. Updated Auth Context
**File:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added `updateUserName` function to context
- Allows updating user state with name

### 5. Updated Root Page
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx`
- Added NameModal import
- Added state management for modal visibility
- Shows modal when user has no name
- Automatically hides modal after name is set

## How It Works

1. **User logs in** â†’ AuthContext fetches user profile
2. **If user.name is null** â†’ Modal appears automatically
3. **User enters name** â†’ API call to backend
4. **Backend saves name** â†’ Returns success
5. **Frontend updates user state** â†’ Modal closes
6. **User can now use the app** â†’ Name is saved

## Testing the Feature

### Test Case 1: New User
1. Create a new account (sign up)
2. After email verification (if enabled), log in
3. You should immediately see the name modal
4. Enter your name and click "Continue"
5. Modal should close and you can use the app

### Test Case 2: Existing User Without Name
1. Log in with an existing account that has no name
2. Modal should appear immediately after login
3. Enter name and submit
4. Modal closes, app is accessible

### Test Case 3: User With Name
1. Log in with an account that already has a name
2. Modal should NOT appear
3. App loads normally

### Test Case 4: Name Validation
1. Try to submit with empty name â†’ Shows error toast
2. Try to submit with 1 character â†’ Shows error toast
3. Enter 2+ characters â†’ Should work
4. Try to close modal by clicking outside â†’ Should not close

## Before Deploying

### Backend Setup Required
1. **Run SQL Migration in Supabase:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS name VARCHAR(255);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS users_name_idx ON public.users(name);
```

2. **Deploy Backend:**
   - Backend changes are already in git
   - Make sure Render.com auto-deploys

3. **Test API Endpoints:**
   - Test: `GET /api/auth/profile`
   - Test: `PUT /api/auth/profile/name`

### Frontend Deployment
1. **Test Locally First:**
```bash
cd yarsu_web
npm run dev
```

2. **Build for Production:**
```bash
npm run build
```

3. **Deploy to Vercel:**
```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

## Customization Options

### Change Modal Appearance
Edit `src/components/auth/NameModal.tsx`:
- Change colors in the gradient icon background
- Modify text and descriptions
- Adjust validation rules (min/max length)
- Add more fields if needed

### Change Validation Rules
In `NameModal.tsx`, modify these checks:
```typescript
if (name.trim().length < 2) {
  toast.error('Name must be at least 2 characters')
  return
}

if (name.trim().length > 255) {
  toast.error('Name is too long')
  return
}
```

### Add Name Display
You can now show the user's name anywhere in the app:
```tsx
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext'

function MyComponent() {
  const { user } = useAuth()
  
  return <div>Welcome, {user?.name}!</div>
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Modal doesn't appear
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend API is running
- Check that `/api/auth/profile` returns user data with name field
- Make sure SQL migration was run

### Name doesn't save
- Check network tab for API errors
- Verify backend is receiving the request
- Check Supabase logs for database errors
- Ensure name column exists in users table

### Modal appears for users with names
- Clear browser localStorage
- Check that backend is returning name field in user data
- Verify AuthContext is properly fetching user profile

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add Profile Settings Page**
   - Allow users to update their name later
   - Add other profile fields (avatar, bio, etc.)

2. **Show Name in Chat**
   - Display user name instead of email in chat interface
   - Show "Typing..." with user name

3. **Admin View**
   - Show user names in admin user management
   - Allow admins to edit user names

4. **Name in Notifications**
   - Use name in push notifications
   - Personalize email notifications

## Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your name feature is now fully implemented. Users will be prompted to enter their name right after logging in if they haven't set it yet.
